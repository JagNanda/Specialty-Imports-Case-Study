# Specialty Imports Case Study

This case study was completed for DBAS 27198 (Database Design and Implementation).

It involved creating conceptual database model, converting it to a Relational Logical database model by applying normalization logic so that it is in it's 3rd Normal Form and more. Please see below for more information about the requirements for this case study. Please also see [SpecialtyImports.pdf](SpecialtyImports.pdf) for the actual case and [SpecialtyImportsFinalReport.pdf](SpecialtyImportsFinalReport.pdf) for the solution and report.


## Required Deliverables

1. Conceptual Model

    1. The model will be done using Draw.io or equivalent software. Hand drawn diagrams will not be accepted.

2. Relational Database

   1. Relational logical data model: convert the conceptual model to a relational logical model and make a data structure diagram              for the tables.
   2. Apply normalization: Check the relations by making sure that the tables are in their 3rd normal form. Develop a report that  shows the steps of normalization. After normalization you may need to modify the Data Structure Diagram and the EER based on the normalization results. You must create an EER diagram that would show cardinalities and conditionalities for each relation
   3. Develop the SQL scripts that will create the tables and enforce all the appropriate constraints.
   4. Develop sample SQL scripts that will insert the data to the database (one row in each table)

3. NoSQL DataBase

   1. Convert at least 3 entities to MongoDB Collections. You will need to provide justification on why did you choose the entities.
   2. Create the collection(s)
   3. Develop sample code that writes documents to the collections (one or two documents)
